    "Q1.\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to structure and organize code by representing real-world entities or objects as software objects. OOP aims to simplify the development and maintenance of software by promoting the concept of encapsulation, modularity, and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main objectives of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: OOP encourages breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable modules or classes. Each class encapsulates its own data and behavior, allowing developers to focus on individual components without worrying about the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling data and the methods or functions that operate on that data within a single unit, called an object. This concept provides data protection and ensures that only the object's methods have direct access to its data. It helps in creating more secure and robust code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: OOP promotes the reuse of code through the concept of inheritance and composition. Inheritance allows new classes to inherit properties and behavior from existing classes, enabling code reuse and reducing duplication. Composition enables objects to be composed of other objects, promoting flexibility and reuse of components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: OOP allows developers to create abstract representations of real-world entities as classes. Abstraction focuses on capturing only the essential properties and behaviors of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It helps in managing complexity and simplifies the understanding and use of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. It enables the same code to be used with objects of different types, providing flexibility and extensibility in software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these goals, OOP aims to improve code organization, readability, maintainability, and extensibility, ultimately leading to more efficient and scalable software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.\n",
    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a specific instance of a class. An object is created from a class, which serves as a blueprint or template defining the properties and behaviors the object will have. It encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object in Python has a unique identity, a set of attributes, and the ability to perform operations. The identity of an object is distinct and can be obtained using the built-in id() function. Attributes are variables associated with an object, which store its state or data. Methods are functions defined within a class that can be invoked to perform actions or operations on the object's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in Python exhibit several characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity: Each object has a unique identity, which can be obtained using the id() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Every object belongs to a specific type or class, which determines the set of operations and attributes available to that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "State: Objects have a state represented by their attributes, which can be modified as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: Objects can perform actions or operations through their methods. These methods define the behavior and functionality associated with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in Python follow the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), providing a modular and organized way to structure code. By creating objects, you can model real-world entities, define their properties and behaviors, and interact with them in a structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3.\n",
    "In Python, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects (instances) that encapsulate data and behavior. It defines the structure and behavior of objects of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class contains attributes, which are variables that store data, and methods, which are functions that define the behavior of the class. The attributes and methods of a class are accessed using the dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a class in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def _init_(self, brand, model, year):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",

    "\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.brand} {self.model} is being driven.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects of the Car class\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2020)\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"Ford\", \"Mustang\", 2021)\n",

    "# Calling methods of car2\n",
    "car2.start_engine()  # Output: The Ford Mustang's engine is starting.\n",
    "car2.drive()         # Output: The Ford Mustang is being driven.\n",
    "In this example, the Car class represents a car. It has attributes such as brand, model, and year, and methods such as start_engine and drive. The _init_ method is a special method called a constructor, which is executed when an object is created from the class and initializes its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating objects (car1 and car2) from the Car class, you can access their attributes and call their methods. Each object has its own set of attribute values, but they share the same structure and behavior defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, attributes and methods are two fundamental components of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes: Attributes are the characteristics or properties associated with an object. They represent the state of an object and store data. Each instance of a class can have its own set of attribute values. Attributes can be variables of different data types such as integers, strings, lists, or even other objects. They define the structure and data that an object can hold. For example, in a class representing a car, attributes can include \"color,\" \"make,\" \"model,\" and \"year.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that define the behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform. They operate on the object's data and can manipulate attributes or perform specific actions. Methods can access and modify the attributes of an object. They define the functionality associated with the class. For example, in a car class, methods can include \"start_engine,\" \"accelerate,\" \"brake,\" and \"change_gear.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes and methods are closely related because methods often use attributes to perform their actions. Methods can also modify the values of attributes to reflect changes in the object's state. Together, attributes and methods encapsulate the data and behavior of objects within a class, allowing for the creation of reusable and modular code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.\n",
    "In Python, class variables and instance variables are two types of variables used in object-oriented programming. They differ in their scope and the way they are accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Variables:\n",
    "Class variables are defined within a class but outside any methods. They are shared by all instances (objects) of the class.\n",
    "They are declared at the class level and are typically used to define properties or attributes that are common to all instances of the class.\n",
    "Class variables are accessed using the class name itself or through any instance of the class.\n",
    "They are shared among all instances, so if a class variable is modified, the change will be reflected in all instances of that class.\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class My Class:\n",
    "    class_variable = \"This is a class variable\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _init_(self, instance_variable):\n",

    "Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined within the methods of a class or the class's constructor (_init_ method).\n",
    "Each object (instance) of the class has its own set of instance variables, which can have different values.\n",
    "Instance variables are accessed using the way instance name (object) itself within the class or outside the class.\n",
    "Changes to instance variables are local to that particular instance and do not affect other instances or the class itself.\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def _init_(self, instance_variable):\n",

    "print(obj1.instance_variable)  # Output: Modified instance 1\n",
    "print(obj2.instance_variable)  # Output: Instance 2\n",
    "In summary, class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are accessed using the class name. Instance variables are unique to each instance and are accessed using the instance name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.\n",
    "In Python, the self parameter is a convention used to refer to the instance of a class within its methods. It is the first parameter declared in a method definition and is automatically passed when the method is called. By convention, self is the preferred name, although any other name could be used as long as it follows the convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self parameter allows you to access and manipulate the instance variables and methods of a class within its own methods. When a method is called on an instance of a class, the instance itself is automatically passed as the self argument. This enables you to work with the specific data and behavior associated with that particular instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of self:\n",
    "class My Class:\n",
    "    def _init_(self, x):\n",

    "In this example, self.x refers to the x attribute of the instance my_object. The print_x method can access and manipulate this attribute because of the self parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using self is important to distinguish between instance variables (specific to each instance) and local variables (specific to each method). It helps in maintaining the state and behavior of individual instances of a class. Without the self parameter, you wouldn't have access to instance-specific data within class methods.\n",
